# best_coding_practices
The goal of this repository to help beginner developers to learn about best coding practices and help them to improve the quality of their software.

## Tutorials
If you are not familier with best coding practices in python I recomand to read [best coding practices](doc/best_coding_practices.md) document first.

## Installation
If you are using anaconda you install all the require library by importing the [environment.yml](installation/environment.yml).
Before importing the yml file please replace [username] by the valid name.
Then open anaconda prompt and enter the following comments
conda env create -f best_coding_practices/installation/environment.yml
if you do not have anaconda install the you need to install following libraries:
- Python 3.7+ is required
- pip install matplotlib
- pip install opencv
