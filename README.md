# best_coding_practices
The goal of this repository to help beginner developers to learn about best coding practices and help them to improve the quality of their software.
This repository is a collection of small and focused projects - each try to convert the naive code to a well defined and structured code. A strong focus is to illustrate best coding practise by using the modular and object oriented programming. 

## Tutorials
If you are not familiar with best coding practices in python I recommend to read [best coding practices](doc/best_coding_practices.md) document first.

## Installation
If you are using anaconda you install all the require library by importing the [environment.yml](installation/environment.yml).
Before importing the yml file please replace [username] by the valid name.
Then open anaconda prompt and enter the following comments
conda env create -f best_coding_practices/installation/environment.yml
if you do not have anaconda install the you need to install following libraries:
- Python 3.7+ is required
- pip install matplotlib
- pip install opencv
- pip install numpy

## Project details
- **beginner_programming:** In this project you will see the result of writing naive and unstructured code. 
- **advance_programming:**  In this project you practise best coding practices and how to write a modular code.  
- **best_practice_programming:** In this project you will learn about design pattern.
